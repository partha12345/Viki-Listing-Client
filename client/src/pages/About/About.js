       <p>An import-export business plan is the first step in starting your business. A business plan acts as a roadmap for your future endeavours of the company. A business plan consists of a financial plan, management plan, daily expenditures of a business, import and export costs, warehousing costs, location charges, transportation cost, labour cost, etc.</p>
       <p>The next step is to choose a location for your export firm. A location must be accessible to all the export ports and airports. You need to find a location that best suits your business and customers' requirements. If your firm is accessible to ports, it will help you reduce your transportation costs. A location must be in a good area where you can store your inventories and gold stocks. Opening a firm in a small locality might not be a good idea because it can be risky. You can open a firm where middle-class and rich people reside. Usually, those areas are near airports or ports. It is essential to choose a location that is safe for your business</p>
